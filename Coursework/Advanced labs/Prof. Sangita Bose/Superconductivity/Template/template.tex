\subsection*{Finding the Resistance and Inductance of the given coil}
\subsection*{Detection of the Critical temperature of the chip}
We perform the experiment and get the critical temperature plots as follows
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=11cm]{plot1.png}
	\includegraphics[width=11cm]{plot2.png}\\
	Plot of Mutual Inductance versus the temperature of both parts.
\end{center}
	We are getting the critical temperature of 10.213 K in the real part and 10.410K in the imaginary part. But then we were expecting a critical temperature of 11.2 K. What is more surprising is that there is some deviation in the real and imaginary values.

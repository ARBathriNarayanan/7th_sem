\section*{Objectives:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To study the IR characteristics of plasma with Langmuir probe.
	\item To study the dependence of obtained IR graph by varying pressure, voltage bias and resistance.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Theory:}

\section*{Observations:}
We shall use a step voltage, so that we can study the IR characteristics in one shot.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{voltage}\\
	The step voltage take, the time is on x-axis and the voltage is on Y axis.
\end{center}
\subsection*{Variation of Pressure}

	V-I characteristics of the Plasma as we vary pressure.
\end{center}
We can see a non-linear variation of the graph as we increase the pressure. It first decreases and then increases. The reason might be due to the Paschen effect.
\[V = \frac{Bpd}{ln\bigg(\frac{Apd}{ln(1+\gamma^{-1})}\bigg)}\] 
At constant V, as we vary pressure, at first, it decreases and then it increases logarithmically.
\subsection*{Flipping the circuit}
